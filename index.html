            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>I am a fourth year software engineering student at the University of Guelph. This page will be used to showcase a summary of my co-op experiences at First National along with a description of the employer and job, and a review of how I progressed my goals set at the start of my work term. I am so thankful to everyone at First National for giving me this opportunity to learn and grow. I learned so much these past 3 work terms, and have been able to achieve what I set out for in my personal learning goals!

            <h2>Employer</h2>
            <p>
                First National is Canada's largest non-bank mortgage lender. Since 1988 First National has been servicing commercial and residential mortgages across Canada, with offices in: Toronto, Vancouver, Calgary, Montreal, and Halifax. Over the past few years First National has seen tremendous growth with more than 200 new hires, now totaling over 1000 employees. I worked on developing First National's Broker applications: Merlin Online and Merlin Mobile. Underwriters, brokers, solicitors and others use Merlin to review mortgage applications, generate legal documents, and communicate with other financial institutions. First National also leases Merlin to TD and Manulife for them to use it for their own underwriting. This means that I worked on 3 slightly different versions of Merlin, since each line of business over the years has requested different changes, the different versions have slowly drifted apart.
            </p>
            <h2>Job Description</h2>
            <p>
                My job title was Junior Development Technician and I worked along side 6 other developers, 2 QA and 2 Business Analysts. My team specialized in broker applications, tools that mortgage brokers can use to facilitate mortgage deals. These applications were written in C# and Javascript. We held daily standup meetings and bi-weekly sprint planning sessions as well as frequent knowledge sharing sessions from more experienced team members. Our department used Azure devops to co-ordinate and maintain tasks by updating work time estimates, adding comments and email chains. Some of the tools I used daily were: Git, Visual Studio, Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, Microsoft IIS, App Center, Xamarin and .NET core. My day to day tasks included: updating azure sprint boards, bug fixes and new changes for mobile and web applications, code review for my own changes as well as other team members changes, coordinating testing with QA team.            </p>
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Advance Proficiency of Git
                </li>
                <li>
                    Work on different project types
                </li>
                <li>
                    Learn more about visual studio
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                My goals for this work term were focused on advancing my proficiency with software development tools.

                Before this coop work term I had mostly only used git for assignment submissions for school. Using git this way is not very complicated as its just one push onto a single branch to submit the assignment. Working in industry is very different, because there are many people working on the same git projects and there is real consequence for messing up. I had to get comfortable in this new environment and some of the skills I learned include: creating new branches, pull requests, sorting merge conflicts, and working with different repo levels (developer, release, production, master). Additionally, for school I mostly used Git bash, but for work I used the GUI's inside of Visual Studio and on Azure. My measure of success for this learning goal was to close 15 work items that required git changes and I surpassed this my completing 22. Overall, this work term I greatly improved my knowledge and comfort with git.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                My next goal was to work on different project types in order to discover what I enjoy developing. I set out to work on web application projects, mobile app projects and database/server changes. I would have liked to make more database changes than I did because it is something I find interesting, but I did discover that I did not really enjoy working on server changes. I found working with connection strings to be quite tedious. Prior to this co-op term I had no experience working on mobile projects, but I really enjoyed working on the mobile app this work term and will absolutely be interested in working on mobile apps in the future, and this has got me interested in taking the mobile computing course next winter. The majority of my work was focused on web applications and I found changes for these to be pretty straightforward and I enjoyed working on these projects. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                My final goal was to learn more about using visual studio. Before this work term I had used vs code for school work, and the step up to visual studio is huge. Some of the visual studio skills I learned include: building, running, debugging and publishing solutions, connecting to Macbooks, hot reload, git gui, build dependencies and project references. At first looking at visual studio was quite daunting, but as I gained more experience my confidence grew as well as my productivity. I certainly have not mastered visual studio but have made a great improvement in my skillset.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                My experience at First National has been invaluable to me, I have been able to work with and learn from so many great people. I was able to work on an interesting piece of software that saw the work I did actually get implemented and be used by real people. I was able to apply the knowledge I have gained so far in my degree and previous work terms into a real world setting. Finally, I would like to thank everyone I worked with on my team this term: Teddy, Ankur, Spencer, Crina, Trevor, Harpreet, Nishita, Mohammed, and Danish.
