            <hr class="rounded">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>I am a third year software engineering student at the University of Guelph. This page will be used to showcase a summary of my co-op experience at First National along with a 
                description of the employer and job, and a review of how I progressed my goals set at the start of my work term. I am so thankful to everyone at First National for giving me 
                this opportunity to learn and grow. I learned so much these past 8 months, and have been able to achieve what I set out for in my personal learning goals!

            <h2>Employer</h2>
            <p>
                First National is Canada's largest non-bank mortgage lender. Since 1988 First National has been servicing commercial and residential mortgages across Canada, with offices in: 
                Toronto, Vancouver, Calgary, Montreal, and Halifax. Over the past year First National has seen tremendous growth with more than 200 new hires, now totalling over 1000 employees.
                I worked on testing First National's in house residential mortgage approval software "Merlin". Underwriters, brokers, solicitors and others use Merlin to review mortgage 
                applications, generate legal documents, and communicate with other financial instituions. First National also leases Merlin to TD and Manulife for them to use it for their own
                underwriting. This means that I worked on 3 slightly different versions of Merlin, since each line of business over the years has requested different changes, the different
                versions have slowly drifted apart. 
            </p>
            <h2>Job Description</h2>
            <p>
                My job title was QA specialist and I worked along side 4 other QA members, 8 
                developers and BA. My team specialized in document changes and bug fixes, and we also worked on new Merlin changes from time to time. We held daily standup meetings and 
                bi-weekly sprint planning sessions as well as frequent knowledge sharing sessions from more experienced team members. Our department used Azure devops to co-ordinate and 
                maintain tasks by updating work time estimates, adding comments and email chains. My day to day tasks included: designing, executing and documenting test activities for bug 
                reports and new changes, updating test results and regularly releasing finished work on evenings and weekends into production environment.
