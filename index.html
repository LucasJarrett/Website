            <h2>Job Description</h2>
            <p>
                I worked on testing First National's in house residential mortgage approval software "Merlin". Underwriters, brokers, solicitors and others use Merlin to review mortgage 
                applications, generate legal documents, and communicate with other financial instituions. My job title was QA specialist and I worked along side 4 other QA members, 6 
                developers and BA. My team specialized in document changes and bug fixes, and we also worked on new Merlin changes from time to time. We held daily standup meetings and 
                bi-weekly sprint planning sessions as well as frequent knowledge sharing sessions from more experienced team members. Our department used Azure devops to co-ordinate and 
                maintain tasks by updating work time estimates, adding comments and email chains. My day to day tasks included: designing, executing and documenting test activities for bug 
                reports and new changes, updating test results and regularly releasing finished work on evenings and weekends into production environment.
